	Easier to see at a glance
	logic separated from structure
	keep track of ids and classes applied to elements
	
- Probably wouldn't us p5 for displaying graphs
	- There are other frameworks that come with more robust visual representations and functionality
	- Don't need to remake the wheel

- Better UI
	- Menu that sits on top of the content with a set of buttons for settings etc.
		This would also better frame the content
	- More animation on buttons
	
- Concept did not turn out how I wanted it to
	- Its not exactly what I envisioned. Not saying what I wanted.
	- Needs a lot more research
		Data should be more talored and include more eras of american politics ******
	- Separate modules for Senate and Congress
	- Supreme court may have been a better game
	- Functionality is too bare for an engaging game
	- No pacing. Game starts, user votes, game ends. Kinda bland
	- Visual style not homogenous 
	- Needs a better title
